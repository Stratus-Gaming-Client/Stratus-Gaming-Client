    <h1>Plans</h1>
    <h3>Automatic Game Installation</h3>
    <p>This will allow games to be installed just by submitting a form to the app. You may have seen a file called install.php, this is the start of the automatic game installation. However, it is still in development and doesn't currently work.</p>
    <h3>No Game Installation</h3>
    <p>This will come long after automatic installation. This will allow games to be loaded from the Stratus servers every time you want to play. This has been the plan since the development of Stratus first started.</p>
